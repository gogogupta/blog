<p>
I am a Senior Product Manager with 8 years of experience, including 5 years in Product Management. I have experienced in Gaming, SaaS, and Ecommerce products. 

I am a data-driven product manager who loves building products that are 1) loved by users and 2) create a business impact. 

Currently, I head Octro Poker and Teenpatti at Octro Inc, a Sequoia-backed gaming company. I have scaled Octro Poker, a U.S.-focused game, from scratch to $X million in annual revenue and increased Teenpatti, one of Indiaâ€™s top-grossing games, by Y0% within a year. 

Previously, I built a product for SalesHandy, a SaaS email marketing tool. During my tenure, the ARR grew by 40%.

As a Software Developer, I built tools to automate Seller APIs (a collection of 300+ APIs) at Snapdeal, an e-commerce company. Furthermore, I created tools to visualize the overall health of the Seller API system.

Key Skills: 
1. Understanding various business models and creating product visions for market success. 
2. Using analytics and design to identify consumer patterns and market gaps. 
3. Leading and mentoring cross-functional teams of product managers, analysts, developers, and QA. 
4. Strong knowledge of acquisition, engagement, and monetization strategies for mobile games. 
5. Linking social game KPIs to core game designs for business growth. 
6. Excelling under pressure and inspiring teams to exceed CXO expectations. 

Tools: 
1. Analytics: Excel/Google Sheet (including automation), SQL, Google Analytics, Mix Panel, and Tableau. 
2. Project Management: JIRA, Trello, and Asana.
3. Design / Wireframing: Figma, Balamiq and Draw.io.
4. Miscellaneous: Roam Research, Miro, and Notion.

I love to read and travel. I read for 60 to 90 minutes each day and visit at least one new place every quarter. Both activities give me a new perspective on the world.

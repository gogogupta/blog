If your game’s D1 retention is below 30%, stop adding features. There is a deeper issue. The core loop is not fun. Scaling a game with a broken loop will not help it grow.

D1 retention gives an early signal about the fun. Sometimes, onboarding is broken. Users do not reach the gameplay screen. This reduces Day 0 gameplay time, which lowers D1. If users enjoy the game and play for a few minutes on Day 0, they are more likely to return. That is why D1 is closely tied to D0 gameplay.

Push notifications can help, but only when used right. People forget apps easily. A reminder helps, but it cannot fix the core problem.

So, how do you increase D1 retention? First, the player should be thinking about your game after their first session. If they forget it, they won’t come back. LiveOps will not help. Login bonuses will not help either. New users usually have enough coins to play for the first few days.

If your game is niche and not for everyone, that is okay. In such cases, track D2 retention and the D2/D1 ratio. It tells you if the users who like the game are continuing. Show real gameplay in your ads so that only the right audience installs the game.

To improve D1, focus on three things: fast onboarding, fun gameplay, and small early missions. Onboarding should take users to the game quickly. No notification prompts, no bonus offers, no sale banners. Just go from download to tutorial or straight into the game.

Make sure the game is fun. If users leave within a few minutes, something is wrong. Keep fewer choices. Avoid distractions. Add a small mission like “complete 3 rounds” and give a hidden reward. Then offer another mission like “play 5 rounds.” This helps you hold the player’s attention for 10 minutes, which is key for better D1.

Ask for notification permission later on Day 1. Lock some content and let users unlock it by playing. This creates a feeling of progress.

For old games, use a different approach. If it is a single-player game and you already have enough users, do not run new campaigns. New users will not improve the experience. But if it is a multiplayer game, bringing new users can help improve matchmaking.

D1 depends on D0. D2 depends on D1. D3 depends on D2. Retention works like a chain. Fix the first link first
